While only a child he cut his teeth on games like Tron for the ColecoVision and writing BASIC programs for the Commodore 64. In his teen years, he developed his gaming abilities to the point where he was able to defeat Double Dragon with a single quarter. As a young man, Jufe took college courses in engineering and computer science and found himself employed as a software developer making Visual Basic applications. In his off time he would make websites for his friends’ band with photoshop slices and frames. Jufe moved to Nashville after being laid-off at the end of the .com bubble. Some of the more memorable moments of that time were long GTA3 sessions with one of his roommates. After 7 years in Nashville and losing another good job to another bubble - this time housing - Jufe returned to New York to earn AS degrees in Engineering Science and Math/Science and find employment in Mechanical Design working on R&D projects. 2013 saw him return to Nashville to rekindle an old romance; a process that has resulted in him being an expectant father. Jufe continued working as a mechanical design engineer for a time but found the manufacturing environment unfulfilling. Now, nearing completion of the 6 month program at NSS, Jufe finally has both the hardware and software skills to build his army of giant robots to conquer… er… save the Earth!"
